Long bevor todays excitement about the take-over or dictate of machine imagined, men was treated and even programmed like machine.  Education, the flow and rules of life and measures have been dominated supporting machine and automation. So dystopia is not for machine to take over, it’s the reality that people plan and structure their life following machine and it’s necessities.

It doesn’t need the reluctance of Mormons or the sensitivity of [UNABomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski)  (who contrary to his conviction harmed humans and not machine) to recognize that there’s technology on this planet somehow serving but more less commanding humanity.  With the propagation of machine rules became practice for all aspects of life and gaps had to be filled. Machine needs (and uses) men to facilitate tasks it can't fulfill (still) or where the business case doesn't allow for automation. Also these activities had to follow the rhythm of machine. And today many humans, without questions raised, are and want to be in command by machine.

Paradoxical a starting point in the machine age for humans has been in the  reconnaissance.  In an age fulfilled with freeing the humans and their mind, to liberate people from a historical dictate, Julien de la Mettrie in France published „L’homme machine“. The intend being to free men from being religious, from being considered a creature of god with all its associated unknowns, secrets and mystics. He sketched human nature as comparable to machine, transparent, deterministic, reproducible. Which resulted in an intuition of a machine like being and the obvious consequence to plan and use men like machine. Humans lost the shield of mystics and became a predictable, programmable resource.  ~Men transforms from a derivation of god to a derivation of machine.~

Based on continuous developments the experience of machine is evolving. Refined cognitive capabilities, the ability to learn and adapt to predicted change, improve communication and even allow to emulate social behavior. The interaction level of machine gets closer to the perception of human interaction, although the mental model for dialogue seems far away, the pressure for humans to adapt to machine decreases. Machine may become an ecosystem of its own, at some point even maintaining itself. Men will be in charge to administer, inspire and develop future innovations.

As machine grows capabilities to effectively support human qualities of life, men increasingly don’t need to behave like machine, be educated for machine interaction or follow programs anymore. Men can get rid of its programming and have the chance to become self-determined individuals. Men might escape the automated domain, forget about schedules and time (another tool to program men, [time does not exist](http://www.thejournal.ie/readme/carlo-rovelli-time-does-not-exist-3464555-Jul2017/)) and might explore a unique, individual life. Although here comes the point: The progression of men is the real challenge, not the imagined threat by machine. What will humans be not being a clerk to machine? How will human kind evolve in the light of independence of machine?

So why is this a consideration for a design and technology company, busy innovating businesses and developing digital value-add? 

	- There’s still a huge challenge in front of designers and developers to adapt machine to human levels and to free humans from the adaptation to machine. 
	- It’s not against human race to automate dump activities and automated repetitive jobs as far as feasible. Labour in programmed cycles is for machine, not for men. Monitoring cyclic repetitive proceedings is for machine, not for men. 
	- Men and machine don’t belong in the same control loop. Different qualities don’t belong in line. Pressure or race conditions against machine are not human and introduce error prone behavior. Actually qualities are about enough time, like for the handover of machine to manual operation so men can react in control.  
	- Machine has to be build transparently and predictable. Up to a point where men understands machine communicating with machine. 
	- Machine emulating humans and simulating feelings is always close to an „un-canny valley“, a snaplike insight of the unreal. Machine will communicate towards human standards and gain social status, but can’t convey the energy of physical hugs. Interaction with machine doesn’t come free, it’s not love. 
	- Predictive qualities of machine reduce the information richness of life. Design has to manage the huge contraction of men to become part of systems and on other side the need for rich content, being a result of independent individual life. 
	- Also for people handicapped the objective needs to be to amplify capabilities to be human, not machine.    

So if we don’t want to loose richness of information and life connected to the planet, the future is not about being in dictate of machine. The future is about machine to provide support for men to live a human life. To become “artists” instead of repetition workers, to exchange love physically and literally, to find their individual celebration of life and their own way to spend time. 

The real challenge for human kind is to evolve not following machine.
