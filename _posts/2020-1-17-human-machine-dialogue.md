Inspirations for an ideal HMD

Human-Machine-Dialogue (HMD) grows beyond Interfaces(see HMI), more networked and systemic behind the scene, applying predictive intelligence and addressing all human senses. Given the following inspirations, dialogues can be designed and developed in favor of man:

- **Human** -- The Leading Principle is for machine to follow man. Humans should not be forced to adapt to machine. Rather machine, at least the ones communicating, needs to understand human senses and reach a cognitive level to interact. Which prevents necessity for training or other prerequisites limiting applications. 
- **Context** -- Machine to communicate and interact in a context - time, space, mood, mode and so forth. The system intelligence behind HMD needs to understand and build on this context, it can't act as autonomous ego or behave like an autist. Which addresses one of the biggest challenges of HMD as well: Repetition and Confirmation. Context is synonym with effective dialogue.
- **Transparent** -- As HMD typically is build as system of several entities, humans need to understand the exchange of these entities as well. Dialogue of machine with machine (MMD) has to be transparent for man and, if intended, needs to be understood by man. Which creates trust and an understanding of actions and delegation.
- **Automation** -- The environment around machine needs to support automated action following the HMD. Machine can't be about programming man. As by navigation systems, "Turn right, then sharp left”. Capable and entitled to execute actions on behalf of man, the perceived value and intelligence of machine will grow. And if machine can't execute, it must be sufficiently intelligent to admit.
- **Hero** -- Machine needs to aim for making the user a hero. The statement is "Don’t let me look stupid", so machine needs to understand human capabilities and prepare action by man not suitable for automation.
- **Time Machine** -- Keep humans out of the race. Machine is about automation, automation is about acceleration, acceleration if for machine not for humans. Involve man only for essential matters and give them time. One of the biggest gifts (and achievements) by machine, is to give man time, to think, to react, to enjoy.
- **Recognition** -- Think about humans not recognizing their opposite when talking: cloths, shoes, watches, scratches. Quality needs to get close to human recognition, for defined subjects involved in the dialogue. Fast recognition, even of moods, is paramount for HMD.
