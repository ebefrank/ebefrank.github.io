title: AI Business Approach

---

Artificial Intelligence - Intelligence is the benefit for your Client and what you want to sell. Artifical is the challenge, as all models are wrong but sometimes useful.  

- **Business Plan / Canvas**
  - Either an identified Problem
    - Instrumentation / Control
    - Repetition / Automation / Acceleration
    - Communication / Dialogue
    - Recognition
  - Or identified Technology
    - In search of a problem
    - In search of a market
    - Making sense of a morph dataset
    - Technology becomes a constraint in the solution space
  - Customer
    - Value
    - Control
    - Personalization
    - Closer to cognitive dialogue
  - Cost Case
    - Availability of quality Data, defined outcome, cost and risk
    - Constraints definition
    - Frequent re-train of images, testing and distribution of updates
    - Team and People dependencies
      - Better organize Knowledge in the System and structured Data
      - Churn of People
    - Support(see Testing), SmartServices Potential and Necessity
    - Risk Management
  - Organization
    - Implications for the Process Layer
      - Internal automation
      - New labour
    - Responsive and Agile
    - IT Utilities and strategic Assets
  - Price
    - Standard or Project
    - AI implies disruptive flexible invests and payment scheme
    - It’s about automation and control, less discounts
    - No intelligence without automation, price for appropriate infrastructure
- **Data**
  - Sourcing of quality Data
  - Control of instrumentation, sampling entities and diversity
  - Ownership of Data and Partaking agreements
  - Understanding of synthetic Data, modifications applied and state of sources
  - Graph or semantic structure allow for alternative and re-use
  - A morph data with unsupervised - What does it tell you?
  - Capability to conduct updates of Datasets
- **Foundation for Algorithms**
  - Next Generation Capabilities
    - Visual Systems
    - Operational pipes
    - Generative Models
  - Math, Engineering, Stats, Distributions
      - Owned key developments 
    - Derive criteria for an industry platform
    - Modeling (Including Virtual Worlds for Testing)
  - Capacities for Problem Solving and Reasoning
    - Architecture (Central, Cloud, Edge, IoT…)
  - Updates, Release Management, DevOps
- **Testing**
  - Really understand the function intended
  - Behavior (AI typically is a black box)
  - Stress cases and fulfillment of QoS
  - Reproduction of behavior including Legal Analysis in Virtual World after incidents
- **Dialogue**
  - Machine Man 
  - Machine Machine, Signaling, APIs
  - Machine Machine Dialogue including Man, understanding yields trust
