---

The Trend about trends, a horoscope for Business. Horoscope, the best friend of any sales man. More inspirations and partaking with open questions, for 2020 and beyond

1. Quality of Labour - Some aged People like to stay in their jobs, if they enjoy, can still contribute and earn appreciation. Will the extension of work life, to save pension funding, go along with the automation of labour not suitable for men?  
2. Consumer Substantiation - New products or services are defined by 1. Consumer (All, Now, Here, Free, Me), 2. Innovation (Technology in search of a market, Disruption) and 3. Constraints (Legacy, Regulation, Business Case, Legal). Number One being the most influential, will there be a forum for Consumers to define products and services contrary to formation of demand by Ads? Will Blockchain become a market for automated digital services to be defined, traded and aggregated by Consumers? 
3. Lifestyle - Will humans continue to live their lifestyle (given by the Gods, coughing for Jobs), will they adapt their life style (in order to save at least some style) or will humans take control of System-Earth (like making the Weather)?
4. Car Business - A modern Car will be the first product for Consumers to control business parameters. Connected, Intelligent and Programmable, incl. Wallet with ID and Budgets and so forth will support new business models like adhoc Pay-per-Use. Will Car become a Business Model for the average owner and create income?
5. Fundamentals - Will transaction and trade with Tokens based on fundamentals (form and function go together) like CO2 and Water come into play? Transparent all the way up to Tax and public spending, to identify the purpose for resulting investments? 
6. Proof of Twin - How to proof instantly the validity of a Digital Twin from real to virtual, being it Map object, Token or Status? Via Graphs, via Semantics or even via Entanglement? 
7. Keys - How to recover Private Key information if it get's lost? On the contrary, how to clear, really clear, Key information from entities involved in a transaction? 
8. Legal Machine - To predict Machine Learned behavior seems only feasible emulating in the Digital Twin environment. Will breach of law or accidents involving Robots be analyzed in the Twin world and will jurisdiction be based on this analysis? Will there be a Robot Index (like Social)? 
9. Adapt to Machine - Recent remark on the acceptance of an IT system for the german army, "there has to be a Change of Minds". Do People, given Machine Intelligence and almost a level of cognition, still have to change for Machine? 
10. Guide Mobility - Will the claim for autonomous drive change towards guided drive defined by constraints, user experience and public regulation? Will OEMs lead or be let for inner City mobility? 
11. Partaking - Public initiatives are often blocked by interest groups, even when considered beneficial for the community as a whole. Will partaking, benefits gained from individual contribution, tune initiatives and motivate acceptance? 
12. Circular Systems - Being it Water or raw materials, the challenge will grow from "how to use" to "how to re-use". Can Circular Systems in different contexts be established and maintained? Can Circular Systems be based on Coal or Nuclear energy? 
13. Trade Index - In professional sports and horse racing algorithms like ELO and Glicko are used to build indexes as indication for bets (think risk management for investments). Can a Human Collaboration or Trade Index be established, to value insights, evaluations and contributions? 
14. Quantum Computing - Is Quantum Computing a Solution for a Problem or a Technology in search of a Market?
15. Animals - Exchange of futures for Water and even wild animals, to kill and to care, seems business practice. Will the re-creation of animals become a business as well and will artifical animals be appreciated or not? Like Zhora says in Blade Runner "Would I work in a place like this, if I could afford a real snake?"
